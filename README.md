* The market sales forecasting project focuses on predicting sales demand for various items in different stores using historical sales data from 2010 to 2013.
- It involves analyzing Walmart's department-wide sales, incorporating factors like promotional markdowns and economic indicators to improve inventory management and strategic planning in retail operations.
- The project employs algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine to forecast weekly sales, with Random Forest demonstrating the best performance in terms of accuracy.
- Methodology includes data cleaning, merging features and store data, handling NaN values, and dividing data into training and testing sets with weekly sales as the target variable.
- Model performance is evaluated using hold-out validation, focusing on the Mean Absolute Error as a key indicator of model effectiveness.
- Future improvements will involve enhancing data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploring deep learning techniques, and incorporating external data like economic indicators and weather conditions to refine the predictive model for better decision-making in retail operations.
